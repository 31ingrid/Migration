# Migration
This contains code for evaluating migration among populations of blackspotted rockfish and Pacific cod, and can be generalized to other species.

Modules COV_2pops_GM.R and COV_2pops_SM.R were used in Table 3, Figure 2, and Figures S2-S4. Modules COV_2pops_GM_obserr.R and COV_2pops_SM_obserr.R were used in Figure 4, COV_2pops_GM_relpopsize.R and COV_2pops_SM_relpopsize.R were used in Figure 3, and find_steepness_1sex_cod.R and find_steepness_1sex_blackspotted.R were used to find steepness and F40%. Figure 3 was generated using COV_2pops_SM.R, COV_2pops_GM.R, COV_2pops_SM_age0migration.R, COV_2pops_GM_age0migration.R, COV_2pops_SM_maturemigration.R, and COV_2pops_GM_maturemigration.R.
